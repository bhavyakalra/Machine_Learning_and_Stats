ABALONE - 
Introduction To The Dataset

Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.
 
 I have applied various Regression and Classification techniques on the data to find out the best of the supervised techniques.
 
 ECOMMERCE -
 E-Commerce Database is a project based on the GUI .
This is a project based on the visual representation and Statistical Analysis of E-Commerce Data Collected by an E-Commerce Website throughout the year 2010-2011 
The package imported are pandas, matplotlib , seaborn Thinkplot , ThinkStats and numpy library  .

HAPPINESS -
Welcome to World Happiness Report 2016. The purpose of choosing this work is to find out which factors are more important to live a happier life.We also will implement several machine learning algorithms to predict the happiness score and compare the result to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.
 I have applied various Regression and Classification techniques on the data to find out the best of the supervised techniques.
 
 HOUSE - 
 To find and predict the qualities of different house in a particular area. Did some visualization to make it clear and applied Stats to find the best suitable one for an individual.
 
 PLACEMENT DATASET - 
 Placement Database is a project based on the GUI. This is a project based on the visual representation of Placement done in the NorthCap University throughout the years 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 using pandas, matplotlib and numpy library and packages.  
 The problem is to find the differences between the recruiting done between the years.  It is easier to maintain and view or explain the databases or records of the data stored in different tables in a single format for anyone, keeping that thing in mind, we have created an efficient system which will display the visual representation of the PLACEMENT DATABASE hence making the things easy for even an non-technical person to understand the Data. Also saving the details of the latest placement records it will be easy to show maximum, average packages and graphical representation of top ten companies. 
 
 RESTAURANT RECOMMENDER - 
 Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all type of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks,Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is best place for foodies. The number of restaurant are increasing day by day. Currently which stands at approximately 15,000 restaurants. With such an high number of restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing. This restaurants data aims at analysing demography of the
location and favoritism of the Cuisines. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of
Bengaluru on the basis of food.

SHOPPING CART RECOMMENDER - 
The data consist of random shopping items from a grocery store. I have used and applied different techniques of ASSOCIATION RULE MINING to find and predict the items which are brought together and can help in increasing the sales of a store by targeting customers based on it.

CLUSTERING ON DATA OF 2 UNIVERSITY - 
I have applied different clustering methods to breifly identify between 2 university's students.

CLUSTERING ON WINE DATA - 
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.
By applying different clustering techniques we can find out which wine belongs to which region by detecting the alcohol percentage.
